## Project Overview

This Python script leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to **analyze**, **visualize**, and **narrate** insights from a dataset. The script performs the following steps:

1. **Reads the dataset** with automatic encoding detection.
2. **Generates a correlation heatmap** to visualize relationships between numerical features.
3. **Queries an AI model** to extract insights and provide a narrative based on the dataset summary.
4. **Generates a comprehensive README** containing the dataset summary, AI insights, and visualizations.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the integration of machine learning, data visualization, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze datasets and present meaningful insights.

## Features

- **Dataset Analysis**: Automatically detects the encoding and reads the dataset for further processing.
- **Data Visualization**: Creates a correlation heatmap for numerical features.
- **AI Insights**: Uses an LLM (GPT-4o-mini) to analyze the dataset and generate textual insights.
- **Comprehensive Report**: Generates a well-structured **README.md** file containing the data summary, insights, and visualizations.
